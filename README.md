	***This is a Segmentation method based on MRF as proposed by Sahar Yousefi et al.***

Developer: 

	Sahar Yousefi, syousefi(-at-)ce.sharif.edu	

Functions:

	In this project the below algorithms for brain MRI segmentation are implemented:
		1- Expectation Maximization
		2- Traditional MRF models contain:
			MMD_Metropolis
			ICM
			Gibbs
		3- MetropolisGenetic
		4- MetropolisACS
	For more information you can study the papers which are mentioned in the Licence section.

	Input:
		imanm: gray color image name
		k: Number of classes 
	Output:
		mask: clasification image mask
		mu: vector of class means 
		v: vector of class variances
		p: vector of class proportions
